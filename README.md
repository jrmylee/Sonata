# Sonata

Project for chord recognition using deep RNNs.  Designed to be used with the Isophonics Dataset(http://isophonics.net/),
but can be used with any dataset with labeled chords corresponding to a time interval.  

Note: Datasets do not come with corresponding audio due to copyright concerns.

Examples usage is in the works
